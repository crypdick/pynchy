# Example Directive

This is a template showing what a directive file looks like. Directive files
contain system prompt extensions that are injected into the agent's context
based on scope matching in config.toml.

## What Goes Here

- Persona and behavioral instructions
- Communication guidelines
- Tool usage instructions
- Domain-specific knowledge
- Workflow descriptions

## What Does NOT Go Here

- Ephemeral per-run context (use system_notices instead)
- Secrets or credentials
- Anything that changes frequently (invalidates KV cache)

## Tips

- Keep directives focused on a single concern
- Use scope to limit directives to relevant workspaces
- Files ending in .EXAMPLE are automatically ignored by resolve_directives()
