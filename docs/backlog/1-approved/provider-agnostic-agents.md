# Provider-Agnostic Agent Interface

Make the repo less dependent on Claude SDK. Define a generic interface for agents and let people install plugins for other LLMs.

## Context

Currently tightly coupled to the Claude Agent SDK. A generic agent interface would allow swapping in other providers (e.g. [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs/)).

## Plan
TBD
