# Why Pynchy?

Everyone is writing their own AI assistant. Why write another one? The biggest reason is that I wanted something written in Python, because that's what I'm most comfortable with.

## Comparison to Related Projects

- [ZeroClaw](https://github.com/theonlyhennygod/zeroclaw) looks great actually, but I don't know how to write in Rust. If I did, I would probably use that instead.
- [NanoClaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw) is a bit too minimalist for my liking.
- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is a big inspiration, but it's a monstrosity. It's a security nightmare, and a massive pile of overcooked spaghetti code. Ain't no way I'm running that on my machine.
- [pi mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) is a less crazy project, which actually OpenClaw built on top of. It doesn't have the security features that I want.

## Credits

Huge thanks to [NanoClaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw). This project started as a Python port of that project.
